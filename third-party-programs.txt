Terms for Microsoft “Distributable Code”
1.	License. This software package from Intel (the “Software Package”) contains code from Microsoft (the “Distributable Code”).  You are provided a non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, limited right and license only to use and redistribute the Distributable Code as part of this Software Package.  You are not allowed to copy, modify, remove the Distributable Code from the Software Package or redistribute the Distributable Code on a stand-alone basis.
2.	Restrictions. The Distributable Code is licensed, not sold. You are only provided the above rights to use the Distributable Code.  Intel and Microsoft reserve all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights, you may use the Distributable Code only as expressly permitted in these terms. In using the Distributable Code, you must comply with any technical limitations in the Distributable Code that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not:
•	work around any technical limitations in the Distributable Code; 
•	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the Distributable Code, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the Distributable Code; 
•	remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Intel, Microsoft or its suppliers in the Distributable Code; 
•	use the Distributable Code in any way that is against the law; or
•	share, publish, rent or lease the software, or provide the Distributable Code as a stand-alone offering for others to use. 
3.	NO WARRANTY.  THE  DISTRIBUTABLE CODE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the Distributable Code; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.  It also applies even if Intel or Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. 
5.	Export Restrictions. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.
