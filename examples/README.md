This directory contains Intel® Video Processing Library (Intel® VPL) example code.

Please note: this code is provided to illustrate API concepts only.  It is not intended for use in production code or for performance benchmarks.

# api1x_core:
These examples demonstrate use of the legacy 1.x core API subset which remains portable across hardware enabled by both
Intel® Media SDK and Intel® VPL GPU runtimes.  (The core API subset is Media SDK 1.x API - features removed in Intel® VPL.)
This style of coding can use Intel® VPL implementation capability queries but applications must manage surface allocation.  
Use this approach for maximum portability when legacy hardware support is required.
For more information see our [Transition Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/upgrading-from-msdk-to-onevpl/top.html)

# api2x:
This group of examples demonstrates use of 2.x API capabilities including internal allocation.  This means that applications
do not need to manage surface allocation lifecycles.
Use of these examples requires a runtime implementation compatible with the 
VPL 2.x API, such as the [Intel® VPL GPU Runtime](https://github.com/intel/libvpl-intel-gpu).  
Please note: the [Intel® Media SDK runtime](https://github.com/Intel-Media-SDK/MediaSDK) only provides API 1.35, and is not
compatible with these examples.

# interop:
The examples in this group showcase pipelines combining Intel® VPL media capabilities with other APIs such as the OpenVINO™ Toolkit Interface.
